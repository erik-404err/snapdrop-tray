# snapdrop-tray
Crossplatform Snapdrop Client with functional Tray Icon, ported with Electron

# Installation:
- nothing here yet

# How to use it?



# Known issues:

- When sending a File via the Tray Icon, the application holds for a few seconds, making the Filesharing prosess slower.
- When sending Text messages via the Tray Icon on Linux, the Inputbox has black corners. This is caused by electron not supporting transparent background on linux (yet). 
- When reloading the application, the old device is still found in Snapdrop
- The Window isnt in the perfect positioning for everybody. This can be fixed by (somehow) getting the screenresulution of the client
